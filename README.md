# Log Parsing Kata

This code is made up of iterations for a possible programming challenge during candidate interviews.

I have written articles around every iteration, starting with an opener.

1. [A Man with a Three Page Path Challenge](https://danielfrost.dk/a-man-with-a-three-page-path-challenge.html)
2. [Three Page Path Challenge - Thoughts and first iteration](https://danielfrost.dk/three-page-path-challenge-first-iteration.html)
3. [Three Page Path Challenge - second iteration](https://danielfrost.dk/three-page-path-challenge-second-iteration.html)
4. [Three Page Path Challenge - third iteration](https://danielfrost.dk/three-page-path-challenge-third-iteration.html)

You can find a branch in this repo with the name for each iteration.

[For the last iteration, you want to start from this type](https://github.com/Danielovich/LogParsingKata/blob/thirditeration/logparserkata/PathPatternsAnalyzerTests.cs)
